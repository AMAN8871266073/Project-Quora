## Project - Quora

### Key points

#### Validations

- Please include all the basic validations in code this time. For example you should write your own code to ensure that a userId passed as the path param must be a valid ObjectId and in such a case the error should be handled within the try block and not the catch block. This applies to all the validations whose failure lead to a 500 error. A valid error should be 400, 401, 403 or 404, as the case may be.

#### Project conventions

- You must submit an explainer video at the end of each day, and not at the end of a feature on an individual basis. If you work for say 8 days in total at this project, there should be 8 videos submitted by you at the end of each day mandatorily.
- In this project also we will work feature wise. That means we pick one resource/ sub-resource like user, answer, question, etc at a time. All the apis on one specific resource would come under one feature. The steps would be:
  1) We create it's model.
  2) We build it's APIs.
  3) We test these APIs.
  4) We will repeat steps from Step 1 to Step 3 for each feature in this project.
- This project is divided into 3 features namely User, Question and Answer. You need to work on a single feature at a time. Once that is completed as per above mentioned steps. You will be instructed to move to the next Feature.

- In this project we are changing how we send token with a request. Instead of using a custom header key like **x-api-key**, you need to use **Authorization** header and send the JWT token as **Bearer token**.
- Create a database Database`. You can clean the db you previously used and reuse that.
- This time each group should have a *single git branch*. Coordinate amongst yourselves by ensuring every next person pulls the code last pushed by a team mate. You branch will be checked as part of the demo. Branch name should follow the naming convention `project/QuoraX`
- Follow the naming conventions exactly as instructed.

## Testing 
- To test these apis create a new collection in Postman named Project quora
- Each api should have a new request in this collection
- Each request in the collection should be rightly named. Eg Create user, Create question, Get questions etc
- Each member of each team should have their tests in running state


## Response

### Successful Response structure
```yaml
{
  status: true,
  data: {

  }
}
```
### Error Response structure
```yaml
{
  status: false,
  message: ""
}
```

## Phase II

- There will be a credit score of 500 for every newly registered user. 
- On posting a **question** there will be a deduction of 100 from the credit score of the OP (the one who posts the question).
- On  posting a **answer** there will be a reward of 200 to the credit score of the person answering the question.
- credit score cannot be **-ve**.
- once credit score reached to 0, user cannot post any question and a suitable message should be displayed to the user. 
- All the Answers of the questions will be sorted on the basis of recency. Example: if there are 10 answers linked to  same question_id then sort 10 answers on the basis of the time the answer was posted. In other words, the question detail should contain the list of answers in an order where the answer posted most recently would be listed first
